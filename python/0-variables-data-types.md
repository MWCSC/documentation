# Variables and Data Types

### What are variables?

From a human perspective, variables are like small boxes that hold a value of some type.
From a computer perspective, variables are sections in memory that hold a value of some type.

### What are variables used for?

Variables are used in basically every program. Since they can hold values, they can be used to store information that can be manipulated later.
Variable values can also be changed. So if you set a variable value at the start of a program, you can change it later on in the program.

### How do you 'declare' a variable?

To declare a variable, simply choose a name and a value. Then assign the value to the name using a `=` sign.
Example:
```
message = 'Hello World!'
```
Here, the name of the variable is `message` and the value is `Hello World`. The quotes show that this is a string data type.

## Data Types

Data types are the different ways that data is defined. For example, numbers are different than words in English. In the same way, integers are different from strings. Here is a table of the different data types:

|Name|Definition|Example|Code|
|----|----------|-------|----|
|String|Words and sentences.|Hello World!|`message = 'Hello World'`|
|Integer|Whole numbers|42|`message = 42`|
|Float|Decimal Numbers|42.0|`message = 42.0`|
|Boolean|True or False value|True|`message = True`|
