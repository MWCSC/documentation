# Variables and Data Types

### What are variables?

From a human perspective, variables are like small boxes that hold a value of some type.
From a computer perspective, variables are sections in memory that hold a value of some type.

### What are variables used for?

Variables are used in basically every program. Since they can hold values, they can be used to store information that can be manipulated later.
Variable values can also be changed. So if you set a variable value at the start of a program, you can change it later on in the program.
