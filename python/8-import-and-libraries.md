# Libraries 

Libraries in Python are a set of usefull functions that eliminate the need to rewrite code from scratch.

Some of the most libaries that will be used in this club include
- numpy (contains mathematical functions not found in basic Python)
- requests (HTTP library for Python)
- pandas (used for data manipulation and analysis)

# Import 

To import libraries in Python, the `import ` function is used followed by the name of the library. For example: 
```py
import numpy
```
# Installing Libraries 

Many Python libraries are not included with the base version of Python. Libraries like numpy, however, are already included.

To install libaries on Python, the following command needs to ran in the cmd terminal: 

```sh
python3 -m pip install
```
Your desired library follows this command. For example:

```sh 
python3 -m pip install pandas
```
