# Comments 

Comments are used to explain code, this applies to all programming languages. In this club, we will heavily use comments to explain our code to others, espeically since we are working in groups.

To write comments in Python, we use `#`, followed by the comments we wish to make. For example:

```py
#this symbol allows us to write comments.
```

We can also `"""` to enclose larger comments, for example:

```py
"""
This allows us to write larger comments.
"""
```
