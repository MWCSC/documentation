## Comments
Comments are used to document your code and keep everything organized. Comments do not show up on the browser.

To include comments in your HTML document, use the `<!-- -->` tag.

### Example:

```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
<!-- Comments are very helpful when working on projects with other people -->
```
