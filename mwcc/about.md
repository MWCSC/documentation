# About MWCC

This document contains the about information about the Mary Ward Coding Club.

MWCC was started in 2022 by [Slate](https://github.com/5late), [Ryan Alumkal](https://github.com/ryanalumkal), and [Nolawi Yonas](https://github.com/nolawiyonas1).

## Club Purpose

The MWCC should be a club open to anyone with an interest in programming/coding and development. The club seeks to educate and grow alongside the members. Executives should work alongside with members on projects, further encouraging teamwork and collaboration.

## Club Pillars

The club was created with the following in mind:

- Low workload
	- The club should not be like another course which members have to worry about after hours
- Project Based
	- The club should focus on projects, not on assignments, tests or individual assesments
- Student Led
	- Students should be at the head of the club. Teachers should be there for supervision/advice, but not for teaching. It is important that the students are the ones leading the meetings

## Club Teams

There are currently 3 teams as part of the MWCC.
	- Beginner
	- Intermediate
	- Advanced
Each team takes on different challenges and projects. Members can move freely throughout the teams depending on where they feel most comfortable.
