# MWCC Documentation

Find documentation on python, webdev, and more here. The one-and-all resource for catching up on things that we've covered at meetings, or resources to learn on your own time.

If you need it, it's here.


### Contribution Guide

If you want to contribute work to the documentation, please follow the following rules:

- All files must be named in lowercase-kebab-case. They must start with a number, and end with a markdown file type.
    - Ex: `1-coding-club.md`
- While grammar and spelling aren't important, please keep your documents tidy. Please also keep the flow of your document easy on the eyes, and easy for beginners to read.
- When publishing your document, please sign it with your name at the end. You can use your real name or your alias. This helps with keeping track of who wrote what.
